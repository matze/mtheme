## Beamer mtheme

The *mtheme* is a Beamer theme with minimal visual. The core design principles
of the theme were described in a [blog post](http://bloerg.net/2014/09/20/a-modern-beamer-theme.html).
Not convinced?  Have a look at the [demo slides](demo.pdf).

### Requirements

As of now, fonts, colors and the section indicator are hardcoded into the theme.
Thus to compile the demo with `make` you must

* use XeLaTeX,
* install the [Fira Sans](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) font,
* have a usable TikZ installation, and
* install the Python package [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) (`pip install pygments`).

Depending on the Linux distribution, the packaged name of Fira Sans might be
`Fira Sans OT` instead of `Fira Sans`. In that case, you may have to edit
`beamerfontthememetropolis.sty`.

To install the theme either run `make install` or copy the style files ending
with `.sty` to the source files of your presentation.


### Package options

* `titleprogressbar` adds a thin progress bar similar to the section progress
  bar underneath *each* frame title

### Commands

* `\plain{title=[]}{body}` sets a slide in plain dark colors.



### pgfplot styles

The beamer theme also contains pre-defined pgfplot styles. Use the `mlineplot`
key to plot line data and `mbarplot` or `horizontal mbarplot` to plot bar
charts.
